#### Connecticut Digital Archive Technical Roadmap Discussion Group  

Technical Roadmap
The Technical Roadmap is a discussion group on how to chart the short and long term technical infrastructure of the CTDA. It is made up at its core of those working directly with CTDA technical infrastructure maintenance and enhancement. This discussion group meets every month. The discussion group is convened by CTDA staff.

Membership:
Technical Roadmap core consists of the CTDA lead applications developer, the CTDA Program Director, and CTDA repository coordinator. Anyone is invited to attend.

Operations:
The Technical Roadmap meets on the 4th Monday of each month for 30 minutes. Meetings can be cancelled for major holidays or for other extenuating circumstances. There is always a virtual component to meetings. Anyone is invited to attend the meetings either in person at the Homer Babbidge Library on the UConn Storrs campus or virtually. Meetings will be announced via the CTDA News blog and on this page.

Participation:
Technical Roadmap discussions are open to anyone interested in the short and long term future of CTDAâ€™s technical infrastructure. At any time, participants may submit an issue or a development idea directly to ctda@uconn.edu or during one of the Technical Roadmap standing meetings. These discussion meetings will focus on how to maintain and enhance the technologies of the CTDA and knowledge of these technologies is helpful for these discussions thought not a prerequisite.

Communication is done through Slack. If you would like to participate and use the TR Slack channel, email [ctda@uconn.edu](mailto:ctda@uconn.edu).
