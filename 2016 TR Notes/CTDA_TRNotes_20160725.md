####Notes:
* [Islandora GSearcher](https://github.com/discoverygarden/islandora_gsearcher): As our system grows, we're looking for ways to enhance performance. We're investigating both this component and tippi sail.
* [DGI Tippi-Sail Adapter](https://github.com/discoverygarden/trippi-sail). Luke Taylor has some great instructions on how to [implement this](https://github.com/discoverygarden/trippi-sail/wiki/Replacing-Mulgara-with-Blazegraph). We look forward to learning more about this at the webinar this Wednesday.
* Problems with slow connection speeds and lost connections: We are aware that the system has been slow. Sites also have been experiencing issues such as losing connection to the repository or coming down. We will post a general message via our Alert list and try to get participants up to date as possible.
* New functionality coming: DGI is creating for us two new tools. The GIS tool will be used to expose the OBJ datastream for all objects with the MODS type of resource cartographic. The enhanced newspaper batch ingest module will allow our participants to ingest multiple issues and pages at a time where each page has to be in a separate folder. After review and testing, an announcement will go out.
* Adding languages to OCR: We will be adding more languages for the OCR. These languages will be taken from the thread on the participants' list.
* CSL IT: CSL IT has requested more detailed status alerts preferable sent through email. At this time, alerts are done through a Google Group which is made public and accessible via the CTDA Collections front page. UConn IT implements internally the PRTG software. UConn IT has created a series of dashboards. We will see if these are accessible outside of UConn. We will also be investigating the historic data that can be exported from this system.
* Content model for serials: There really isn't an intuitive content model for serials in the way that CSL would approach something like a holdings record or a checkin card. An alternative is to create a collection for the serial.
