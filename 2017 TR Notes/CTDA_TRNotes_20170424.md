### Notes

* Infrastructure Plan update: We are currently reviewing what our vendor upgraded. Our vendor updated a clone of our production system to Fedora 3.8, fedora general search, Solr and installed blazegraph. Our vendor also applied patches for xmlusers permission error and drupal filter error.  
* May 2017 Spring: We will bring all of our systems up with these updates and fixes. Work might extend beyond May 2017.  
* We've asked our vendor to look at an issue effecting compound object display for parents and children. In our CTDA collections site, http://collections.ctdigitlarchive.org, both children and parents of compound objects display when the site is configured to display only parents.  
* This coming Friday is our 4th Friday for the index update work. Announcements have been sent out.  
* Our [publish dashboard](https://prtg.lib.uconn.edu/public/mapshow.htm?id=7917&mapid=DCDAC9FE-1B3E-4866-B524-1B3FAD38CAAE) that displays our monitoring system now includes how much free disk space exists for our repository.  
* Future plans: We will be enhancing our theme to include better display for details and contact information. We will be looking into how to increase page loading times.
