### Notes

* Infrastructure Plan update:  
We are currently reviewing what our vendor upgraded and seeing to details. Our vendor updated a clone of our production system to Fedora 3.8, fedora general search, Solr and installed blazegraph. Our vendor also applied patches for xmlusers permission error and drupal filter error.  

* May 2017 Spring:  
We have hit delays with bringing upgrading our systems. We are now just completing work on the system delivered to us by our vendor. We are working to update our dev system first. We will provide updates towards the end of May on progress and where we stand.  

* Compound Object children display and XACML:  
If a top level collection has xacml policies enabled, these policies interfer with the configuration to hide children from the RI. There is a short term solution that our vendor can put into place. There is a longer term solution that will take time because it will need to go through the community. We decided to disable xacml policies and walk our participants who work on CTDA manage through this change.  

* This coming Friday is our 4th Friday for the index update work. Announcements have been sent out.  

* Our [publish dashboard](https://prtg.lib.uconn.edu/public/mapshow.htm?id=7917&mapid=DCDAC9FE-1B3E-4866-B524-1B3FAD38CAAE) that displays our monitoring system now includes how much free disk space exists for our repository.  

* Future plans: We will be enhancing our theme to include better display for details, contact information, and looking into fine tuning Solr. We will be looking into how to increase page loading times.
